# Part 1: The Wool Over Your Eyes

Your eyes open to darkness, and your lungs draw in burning air laced in
creosote and tarmac, coating your nose and throat in grit. A heavy hood
covers your face, and where your body is
in contact with the floor it burns as though you lay on the forestones of a
blazing hearth. A collar of metal threatens to sear the raw and chafed flesh
of your neck.

[Bonds-Free]

A low roar echoes perceptibly in some great expanse around you, and as you
regain your wits, you find that the roar seems like quiet to you, though you
don't immediately understand why.

With your hands free, you are able to remove the hood over your head, and
memories of the past few weeks resolve with clarity in your mind's eye:

[Past]

On one terrible evening some weeks ago, at dusk, not a mile from your home,
you were knocked down suddenly from the darkness and clubbed senseless.
When you awoke, you had been bound, gagged, and chained together with two other
unfortunate villagers whom you did not recognize.

Over the course of an increasingly hopeless journey, you were driven
relentlessly through the countryside by your captors, who turned out to be
a dozen mostly silent but thoroughly sadistic gray dwarves. They spoke their
own language of short, hard consonants and savage beatings.

On the second
night after your capture, your party was overtaken by a pair of scouts on
horseback -- men from your village. Almost before a ray of hope could shine
in your heart, the dwarves had killed the scouts with a hail of throwing axes,
and lamed their horses with well-aimed crossbow bolts so that the beasts could
not travel home with speed.

After three days,
a sack was placed over your head and secured in place, your metal collar
re-tighted, your wrist bindings re-tied, and you were driven underground.

For many long days you walked on a lead over wide, smooth stone to nothing but
the echoing sounds of
your footsteps and the sobs of the other prisoners. You attempted to mark the
days by the occurance of the stinking millet gruel the dwarves allowed you
to eat from a pig's bladder by lifting your hood just over your mouth.
These meagre meals came once a day, or less; an estimation warped by fear and
privation.

Finally, your captors' chatter began to grow more frequent. Your terrible
caravan stopped several times over the course of the next few days, amid much
trading of words in horrid languages by figures you could not see. You were
being led down, down, into a place that grew hotter by the hour. When your
caravan stopped for the final time, it was to the sounds of ringing steel and
immense, almost intolerable heat.

After some time, you were pulled roughly to stand near some great source of
heat. It radiated hatefully at you, scalding your flesh with the pain of a
bad sunburn.

A voice began to speak. Words of magic, unknown to you, grave and profane to
your ears. The steel-on-steel ringing intensified, a bell sound struck by
hammer and anvil, and the unseen chamber of stone under your feet seemed to 
itself respond with rising monotonic peals. The ringing clangs built in a
crescendo until you were sure your head would split apart.

The heat before you had meanwhile become something else: a gravity, or an
arrow, which pointed only forward, forward, and down. You felt swept toward
it, endlessly, in a searing rush.

Then, just as the litany of words had become ululation, and the world seemed
ready to break and crumble, you heard another voice, behind you:

"Clarion, stop this madness!"

And the bell-like voice stuttered for an instant, and then cried: "No!"

And then the world cracked, and the black inside your hood fell into a deeper
one.

Bonds-Free:
  1: |
    Your hands are bound tightly by strong cord, but there seems to be
    something wrong with your shoulder: it floats with a sickly pain at your
    side, and seems to slide forward and backward of its own accord. Although
    it nearly makes you retch inside your hood to do so, you are able to
    contort your arm into
    a wholly unnatural position behind your back, which loosens your wrist ties
    enough to pull your good arm free.
  2: |
    You find that your hands are free; the cord that once bound them has been
    broken, and slowly unravels around your wrists. However, your hands are
    numb from long hours having been deprived of circulation. It will take you
    some time to work feeling back into them.
  3: |
    Though your hands are bound, the cord is loose around your wrists. After a
    moments' writhing, you are able to free one hand.
  4: |
    Your hands are bound tightly by strong cord. However, as you move
    tentatively about, still blinded by your hood, your hip bumps against
    something thin and hard: a dagger in its scabbard, evidently still attached
    to the belt of some unknown, unmoving body. Gingerly, moving as little as
    possible, you manage to draw the dagger from its sheath, and set about
    the slow task of cutting your bonds. Just when you are nearly through, an
    ambient popping sound startles you. Your body jerks involuntarily, and you
    stab yourself with the dagger. The silver lining, though: your hands are
    now free.
Past:
  1: |
    You have a past of some kind.
  2: |
    Who knows who you were back then.
  3: |
    You were a winner. But that's all over now.
  4: |
    You were never any good.
